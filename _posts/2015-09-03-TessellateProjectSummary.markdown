# Tessellate
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## What is Tessellate?

Tessellate is a real-time mosaic builder for social events.

## Why did we build Tessellate?

My team and I decided to build Tessellate out of a desire to create beautiful mosaics from pictures taken by our friends at our favorite social events. 

## What does the above even mean?
Ok, so here's how it works. For example, my good friend Adam is getting married next month. He decides that he would like to use Tesselate to build a mosaic for this special day. 
	1) He chooses the main picture of the mosaic, a picture of himself and his bride-to-be.
	2) He generates an event code for all of his friends to use while attending the wedding.
	3) His friends enter the event code and start adding memorable photos to the mosaic.
	4) All of this happens in real-time. Watch the magic unfold!

## What Tech Stack did we use?

Front-End:
	React-Native(Mobile Client)

Back-End:
	Node/Express
