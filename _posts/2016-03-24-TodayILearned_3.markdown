I use web servers everyday. With that said, I've always wondered how they are built. The next three days, I will be reading through a tutorial series by Ruslan Spivak on how to build a basic web server in Python. This first article takes us through the initial TCP connection from client to our server and shows us that once the server is started, it continuously listens for requests. Happy Learning!
